# pandas_cub
This repository contains the code for how to build your own Python data analysis library, pandas_cub, from scratch. The end result will be a fully-functioning library similar to pandas (`pandas_cub` will not have all the functionalities `pandas` library have)

Note: this library will not be the optimized as similar to `pandas` one as this is created just to learn some advance python and how can we create a library from scratch with test-driven developement(TDD) in python.
